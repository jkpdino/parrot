# Parrot

Parrot is a simple language model for learning purposes. In order to learn the whole AI stack, parrot is built in stages:

1. An embeddings model
2. A language model
3. A ChatBot built over the model
4. A website interface for the chatbot

## Language Model

The Parrot Language Model is a small AI LM which can run on any PC. Similar to ChatGPT, Parrot can complete a sentence with a context.


## Future Ideas

- Add memory to transformers
- Weave a AIs together to form a super-AI
  - Language Model with a logic AI to control its output

## Pensive

PensiveLM is a multimodal, open-source large language model designed to be ran on a home computer.

### Goals of Pensive

- Specialize parts of the network
- Work with audio, image, and text modals
- Run on most computers
- Reduce hallucinations
- Maybe add some sort of reward system?


## How to accomplish

- Multimodal
- Long Context Length (ALIBI)
- Sparse Attention
- Flash Attention
- Multi-Query Attention
- CoLT5
